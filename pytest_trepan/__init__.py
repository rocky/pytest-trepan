'''`pytest-trepan` is a pytest_ plugin running the `trepan debugger
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi?:action=display&name=trepan>`_.

After installing, to set a breakpoint to enter the trepan debugger::

    import pytest
    def test_function():
        pytest.trepan()    # get thee into the debugger!
        x = 1
        ...

The above will look like it is stopped at the *pytest.trepan()*
call. This is most useful when this is the last statement of a
scope. If you want to stop instead before ``x = 1`` pass ``immediate=False`` or just ``False``::

    import pytest
    def test_function():
        ...
        pytest.trepan(immediate=False)
	# same as py.trepan(False)
	x = 1
	...

You can also pass as keyword arguments any parameter accepted by *trepan.api.debug()*.

To have the debugger entered on error, use the ``--trepan`` option::

    $ py.test --trepan ...
